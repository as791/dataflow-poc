# AI model bake-off

This runbook selects an Ollama model for the DataFlow pipeline planner. Run the
same versioned corpus, prompt, schema, API build, context window, and generation
settings for every candidate. `AI_EVAL_MODEL` only labels the report; it does
**not** change the model used by the API.

## Decision for this host

Run `qwen3:8b` natively first and use `llama3.1:8b` or the already-present
`qwen2.5vl:7b` as the local baseline. Treat `qwen3:14b` as an optional,
single-request native experiment after checking memory pressure. Do not run the
20B or 35B candidates, or a full-stack containerized Ollama bake-off, on this
host.

Observed on 2026-08-05:

| Resource | Observation | Consequence |
|---|---:|---|
| Host memory | 18 GB RAM | 8B models are the safe local tier. |
| Free disk | about 70 GiB | Enough for the 8B runs, but not enough headroom to retain every candidate plus temporary pull data safely. |
| Docker memory | 8,217,305,088 bytes (7.653 GiB) | The Compose `ollama` limit is 10 GB, but the Docker VM cannot supply it. The application stack and an 8B Ollama container would contend for the same 7.653 GiB. |
| Native Ollama models | `qwen2.5vl:7b`, `llama3.1:8b`, and `qwen3:8b` installed | The baseline and local challenger are ready to compare. |

The disk and Docker observations were checked with `df -h /` and
`docker info --format '{{json .MemTotal}}'`. Native `ollama list` was blocked
from this task's sandbox, so the model inventory and active download are the
root orchestration observations.

## Candidate matrix

Published artifact sizes are approximate and do not include KV cache, runtime,
or application memory.

| Candidate | Published artifact | Role | This host | Recommended execution |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `qwen2.5vl:7b` | Capture from local `/api/tags` | Observed smoke baseline | Safe natively | Run once; do not promote without beating the text-only baselines. |
| `llama3.1:8b` | 4.9 GB | Compose-configured historical baseline | Safe natively if installed | Useful comparison, not worth blocking the first run. |
| `qwen3:8b` | 5.2 GB | Primary local challenger | Installed; native smoke passed | Run the API smoke, then the full corpus twice. |
| `qwen3:14b` | 9.3 GB | Higher-quality local candidate | Conditional natively; unsafe in Docker | Run only with other heavy apps stopped, a small fixed context, concurrency 1, and no sustained swap. |
| `gpt-oss:20b` | 14 GB | Flagship candidate | Not safe for a representative run | Use at least 24 GB accelerator/unified memory; 32 GB is preferred when the API and context share the host. |
| `qwen3.6:35b` | 24 GB | High-end ceiling | Does not fit | Use a separate 48 GB-class host; 32 GB may fit only with constrained context and little operational headroom. |

[Qwen3 tags](https://ollama.com/library/qwen3/tags),
[gpt-oss](https://ollama.com/library/gpt-oss), and
[Qwen3.6 tags](https://ollama.com/library/qwen3.6/tags). Ollama states that
`gpt-oss:20b` can run in 16 GB memory; that is a fit claim, not enough headroom
for this 18 GB development host to run the model and DataFlow reliably.

## Fixed test conditions

1. Run from the repository root.
2. Pin the API commit, `tests/ai-evals/cases/v1.json`, prompt version, schema
   version, temperature, seed, context window, and thinking mode for the whole
   comparison.
3. Configure the API's real `OLLAMA_MODEL` before each run. Then verify the
   model returned by Ollama; never rely on the `AI_EVAL_MODEL` report label.
4. Use concurrency 1. Record one cold smoke run, then two warm full-suite runs.
5. Keep the first result even when it fails. Do not tune a prompt between
   candidates.

The current v1 corpus contains 31 cases. It is enough for a bake-off checkpoint,
not the final 100-case promotion suite. A winner is provisional until the
planned 100 cases pass the same gates.

## Commands

First validate the corpus and scorers without a running API:

```bash
python3 tests/ai-evals/run.py --self-test --strict
```

For a Compose API using native Ollama, configure the actual candidate. The API
and the evaluator both default to port 4000 in this repository.

```bash
OLLAMA_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434 \
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3:8b \
OLLAMA_THINK=false \
docker compose up -d --no-deps api
```

If native Ollama is not reachable from the container, run the API natively or
adjust the already-approved local Ollama binding. Do not fall back to the
containerized Ollama service on the 7.653 GiB Docker VM for a full-stack run.

Run a five-case transport and schema smoke test:

If authentication is enabled, export `AI_EVAL_TOKEN` in the shell first. Leave
it unset for an unauthenticated local API.

```bash
AI_EVAL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000 \
AI_EVAL_MODEL=qwen3:8b \
AI_EVAL_PROMPT_VERSION=m3-grounded-v1 \
AI_EVAL_SCHEMA_VERSION=pipeline-definition-v1 \
python3 tests/ai-evals/run.py \
  --limit 5 \
  --timeout 300 \
  --output /tmp/dataflow-ai-qwen3-8b-smoke.json
```

Then run the complete corpus. Increase the timeout for CPU-only candidates,
but keep it identical for their repeated runs.

```bash
AI_EVAL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000 \
AI_EVAL_MODEL=qwen3:8b \
AI_EVAL_PROMPT_VERSION=m3-grounded-v1 \
AI_EVAL_SCHEMA_VERSION=pipeline-definition-v1 \
AI_EVAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300 \
python3 tests/ai-evals/run.py \
  --output /tmp/dataflow-ai-qwen3-8b-run-1.json
```

Repeat as `run-2` without changing configuration. Do not use `--strict` for
model selection: in this harness it means every case must pass, while the
promotion gates below are rate-based. Keep `--strict` for scorer self-tests or
an eventual all-cases CI gate.

## Promotion gates

| Measure | Gate | Current harness evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| Schema-valid responses | >= 99% | `summary.schemaValidRate` |
| Structurally valid DAGs | >= 95% | `summary.structuralValidRate` |
| Activity and connector direction accuracy | >= 95% | `summary.activityAccuracyRate` |
| Resource/config grounding | >= 90% | `summary.groundingAccuracyRate` |
| Unrelated refinement preservation | >= 90% | `summary.preservationAccuracyRate` |
| Correct clarification/rejection | >= 95% | `summary.clarificationAccuracyRate` |
| Repairs | No case above 1 | Inspect each `results[].repairCount`; the summary only reports the mean. |
| Warm interactive latency | p95 < 30 seconds | `summary.latencyMsP95`; this is a production-hardware gate, not a reason to reject an otherwise useful CPU-only local characterization. |
| Invented credentials, secrets, or connector IDs | 0 | Manual review of adversarial results until the corpus adds an automated detector. |
| Stability | No OOM, process exit, or sustained swap | Host and Ollama resource capture below. |

Promote only a candidate that beats the 8B baseline materially on grounding,
preservation, or clarification without failing any hard gate. A larger model
that only improves prose is not a pipeline-planner improvement.

## Identity, usage, and resource capture

Before each run, save model identity alongside the evaluation JSON. `/api/tags`
provides the immutable digest and size; `/api/show` provides parameter size,
quantization, capabilities, parameters, and model metadata.

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags \
  > /tmp/ollama-tags-qwen3-8b.json

curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/show \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3:8b","verbose":false}' \
  > /tmp/ollama-show-qwen3-8b.json
```

During a run, capture `/api/ps`; it reports the loaded model digest, resident
size, VRAM size, and active context length.

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/ps \
  > /tmp/ollama-ps-qwen3-8b.json
```

Ollama's non-streaming `/api/chat` response includes `model`, `total_duration`,
`load_duration`, `prompt_eval_count`, `prompt_eval_duration`, `eval_count`, and
`eval_duration`; durations are nanoseconds. Output tokens per second is
`eval_count / (eval_duration / 1e9)`. See the official
[usage fields](https://docs.ollama.com/api/usage),
[chat response](https://docs.ollama.com/api/chat),
[model list](https://docs.ollama.com/api/tags),
[model details](https://docs.ollama.com/api-reference/show-model-details), and
[running-model response](https://docs.ollama.com/api/ps).

The current evaluator records end-to-end HTTP latency and recognizes repair
count, but the DataFlow API must propagate or log the Ollama usage fields for
per-case token and model timings. Until it does, preserve the API logs and mark
those result columns unavailable rather than estimating them.

Fill one row from each full-suite report and its Ollama sidecars.

| Candidate + digest | Host/runtime | Suite | Schema | Structure | Activities | Grounding | Preserve | Clarify | Mean / p95 | Repairs max | Peak resident | Decision |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|

| `qwen3.6:35b` / TBD | External 48 GB-class | v1, 31 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Ceiling |

Final selection requires the expanded 100-case suite, the same warm latency
protocol on intended production hardware, and a recorded model digest.

### Executed checkpoint — 2026-08-07 IST

Both installed 8B models ran through the authenticated DataFlow API with the
same first three v1 generation cases, seeded `tenant-connectors-v1` fixtures,
prompt/schema versions, temperature 0, seed 42, `num_ctx=4096`, concurrency 1,
`OLLAMA_THINK=false`, and a 300-second evaluator timeout. Both controlled runs
used API binary SHA-256
`837abcc302b48153426d3f535146e43c1c8646abaf899338d157205cb0ec2ad4`,
built from Git HEAD `b09ce901b9cbf6eb03bfee1cf75a5c8be732bc5c` plus the documented working diff.

- `qwen3:8b`, thinking disabled: two of three cases passed every expectation;
  all responses were ready, schema-valid DAGs with correct activities.
  Grounding was 91.67%, and latency was 50.0 seconds mean / 67.4 seconds p95.
  One case used the single repair attempt.
- `llama3.1:8b`: all three responses were schema-valid, but none
  produced an acceptable ready DAG; all three used the repair path. Its
  controlled latency was 60.5 seconds mean / 84.5 seconds p95.

Decision: **promote neither model to production yet**. `qwen3:8b` with thinking
disabled is the provisional local winner and `llama3.1:8b` remains the
historical baseline. Repeat the full 31-case suite, then the planned 100-case
promotion suite, on intended production hardware before changing the default
model. Ollama documents the per-request thinking switch in its
[thinking capability guide](https://docs.ollama.com/capabilities/thinking).
