# Product gaps before AI agent implementation

Status: proposed for review; no runtime changes. Baseline:
`857f36f51d9d58c05b32a4d2941448b1eeebbcbd`, reviewed 2026-09-09 UTC.
This reconstructs the earlier scope from current source; the original package
was not recoverable. Its reported count of 13 gaps is not a target to fill.

## Scope and release order

Extend Dataflow with durable agents and a mixed data/agent builder. Retain
versioning, tenant-owned credentials, monitoring, audit, lineage and environments.
Review this gap plan first, backend architecture second, frontend architecture
third. Implementation follows explicit review, in separate backend/frontend PRs.
No main-branch push, production rollout or model promotion is authorized by this plan.

## Existing foundations

React canvas and shared pipeline types; Go API; Temporal workflow/activity
workers; connector catalog and saved tenant connections; encrypted payloads;
pipeline monitoring, audit and lineage. AI generate/refine is request-scoped
pipeline authoring, not durable agent execution. Reuse these foundations.
The existing `docs/ROADMAP.md` also records deferred identity/role and production
infrastructure work; its historical entries do not establish deployment status.

## Verified gaps

Internal Go paths below are relative to `apps/workflow-go/`.

| ID / priority | Evidence and consequence | Planned change | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G01 / P1 | `internal/model/types.go:69-70` exposes TimeoutSec/Retry; `internal/workflows/dynamic_dag.go:35-47` applies global activity options. Saved per-node policies are not applied. | Derive validated options at node dispatch, preserving defaults when absent. | Distinct node deadlines/attempt counts work; invalid settings rejected. |
| G02 / P1 | `internal/connectors/registry.go` accepts source/sink manifests; `internal/connectors/runtime.go` has a manifest fallback in Fetch but not Handle. Manifest-only sinks can be catalogued but fail dispatch. | Implement supported sink manifests or reject them at registration; align catalog and runtime in one PR. | A declared supported sink completes a pipeline; unsupported kinds fail before selection. |
| G03 / P1 | `internal/workflows/dynamic_dag.go` drains control signals between levels, without cancelling in-flight activity contexts. | Specify pause versus cancellation, propagate cooperative cancellation and prevent new dispatch. | Cancel during a slow node reaches terminal state without starting new effects; pause resumes without pretending effects were undone. |
| G04 / P1 | August model bake-off: no candidate met promotion gates; all failed refinement and engine/trigger categories. | Diagnose contract failures separately from model choice; controlled new-model comparison. | Preserve all failed cases and all-case denominators; clear gates before changing defaults. See MODEL_EVALUATION.md. |
| G05 / P1 | Tracked `docker-compose.override.yml` hardcodes qwen2.5vl:7b and host Ollama URL, overriding environment-selected base settings during normal Compose merging. | Convert automatic developer override to explicit opt-in example; verify effective config. | Requested model matches effective config and actual serving digest. |
| G06 / P1 | `.github/workflows/integration.yml` is schedule/manual only; `scripts/smoke-test.sh` relies on external HTTPS. | PR sandbox with deterministic model/tool fixtures, preserving production egress validation. | Relevant PRs exercise the stack without paid model keys or public fixture availability; cleanup always runs. |
| G07 / P2 | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` omits the existing Python AI evaluator self-test. | Invoke its strict offline self-test, extend fixtures with shipped contracts. | Invalid corpus/scorer expectations fail PR checks; no new framework. |
| G08 / P2 | CONTRIBUTING and PR template say Apache 2.0; root LICENSE contains AGPLv3. Settings UI also says Apache. | Maintainer confirms intended policy; align wording in docs/UI. No license change in this stack. | Statements match the approved policy. |
| G09 / P1 | `apps/web/src/utils/pipelineConvert.ts` reconstructs a whitelist and drops node timeoutSec/retry/inputAssets/outputAssets and pipeline concurrency on load/save. | Preserve supported definition fields through canvas conversion. | Round-trip test retains every supported policy/asset field and metadata while editing a different node. |

## Corrected assumptions

- Base Compose excluding Ollama is intentional: the AI profile is opt-in.
  Improve setup/preflight instead of making an LLM mandatory for data pipelines.
- AI proposal review already has ready/needs_input/rejected, Apply/Discard/Undo
  and contextual refinement. Extend those flows rather than rebuild them.
- Existing monitoring/audit/lineage does not imply a model/tool step store or
  durable approval protocol. No application MCP client was found in this review;
  developer-tool MCP connections are not a shipped outbound tool runtime.
- Separate uncommitted AI experiments in the original checkout are not assumed shipped.

## Implementation PR sequence after plan approval

| PR | Track | Dependencies | Deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GAP-BE-01 | Backend | Approved execution semantics | G01 node policy and G03 controls; split if review size warrants. |
| GAP-BE-02 | Backend/connectors | Approved support-or-reject decision | G02 catalog/runtime consistency. |
| GAP-CI-01 | CI | Plan approval | G06 deterministic sandbox baseline and G07 offline evaluator. |
| GAP-DOC-01 | Dev experience/docs | Maintainer decision for G08 | G05 explicit override/preflight and G08 wording. |
| GAP-AI-01 | Backend/AI | Failure classification, GAP-CI-01 | G04 contract corrections with unchanged-model evidence. |
| GAP-FE-01 / F1 | Frontend | Plan approval | G09 lossless conversion; reuse and improve existing AI review/error states. |

GAP-* are work packages, not a second implementation stack. B1 contains
GAP-BE-01 (G01/G03) and GAP-BE-02 (G02), plus contract/replay fixtures; it may
split along those review boundaries. GAP-CI-01 supplies the sandbox before
B1/F1 integration acceptance. F1 is GAP-FE-01 (G09). GAP-DOC-01 owns G05/G08;
GAP-AI-01 addresses planner quality separately from agent B2–B6.

The first executing agent slice needs G01–G03, G06 and G09. Non-executing agent
management planning can proceed while model promotion is unresolved. Automatic
acceptance/execution of generated drafts is out of scope.

## Review decisions

Approve priorities/acceptance, choose G02's sink policy, agree pause/cancel
semantics and OSS boundary. B4/F4 demonstrate the complete functional flow; release completion requires
B5/F5 recovery and operations evidence. Mandatory B3/B4 safety checks cannot
be deferred to B5. Review backend and frontend designs separately before
implementation. Refer to SANDBOX_AND_CI.md for the 18 acceptance scenarios.
