# Ollama model assessment and evaluation record

Status: investigation; no production model promotion or default change.
Research date: 2026-09-09 UTC (continuing into 2026-09-10 IST).
Application baseline: `857f36f51d9d58c05b32a4d2941448b1eeebbcbd`.

## Latest recorded Dataflow accuracy

The latest relevant Notion page found was **DataFlow AI Pipeline Builder —
M0–M4 & Ollama Bake-off**, last edited 2026-08-12. Its retained full-suite
measurements are dated August 7, against main `f4a4d824...` on an NVIDIA L4.
A separate search for few-shot results returned that same page, not a newer
completed experiment. This is the latest evidence located, not proof that no
unconnected or differently named report exists.

| Historical model | Passed, two 31-case runs | Warm p95 | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gpt-oss:20b, thinking on | 10 / 10 | 47.41s | Safety-first reference; only 1/8 generation cases, 16 HTTP failures after repair. |
| qwen3:8b, thinking off | 6 / 6 | 23.90s | Faster generation baseline; poor overall task coverage. |
| llama3.1:8b, thinking off | 8 / 9 | 19.04s | Mostly clarification/rejection; no passing generation cases. |

All three failed every refinement and engine/trigger case. None met promotion
gates. Conditional 100% structure/grounding on scoreable responses must not be
presented as 100% end-to-end accuracy. Raw historical reports referenced by the
runbook live under `docs/evals/gcp-main-f4a4d824/` in the prior experiment checkout;
they are not assumed present on this clean main branch.

The current branch and original experiment checkout differ. New measurements
must compare candidates on the same current build; historical cloud latency
is not directly comparable to local laptop latency. Few-shot prompting and
fine-tuning are separate experiments and are not silently enabled here.

## Current official candidates

Registry information is a reason to test, not proof of Dataflow accuracy.
Artifact sizes exclude runtime, KV cache, the application and operating system.

| Model | Published artifact | Fit and next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| granite4.2:8b | 5.3 GB | Newly listed text model with tools/structured JSON support; primary new local challenger at roughly the existing 8B footprint. |
| qwen3.5:9b | 6.6 GB | Practical second local challenger; compare with qwen3 using the same context and thinking controls. |
| gemma4:12b | 7.6 GB | Conditional local candidate; validate runtime/template support and memory pressure before a sustained run. |
| qwen3.6:27b / 35b | 18 / 23 GB | Exceeds practical headroom on this 18 GiB host. Separate larger-memory machine required for representative testing. |
| qwen3:8b | Installed, digest prefix 500a1f067a9f | Current local comparison baseline, not a promoted production model. |

As of this check the official Qwen3.6 library lists 27B/35B, not a 9B tag;
choose verified registry tags rather than a guessed newer version. Gemma E2B/E4B
names describe effective parameters; their default artifacts are 7.2/9.6 GB,
so they are not automatically smaller downloads than the 12B quantized tag.
Do not extrapolate the largest family model's published benchmark to a small variant.

## Local protocol

Host inventory: 18 GiB unified/system memory, approximately 64 GiB available disk,
Ollama 0.30.10. Existing developer services remain running; memory pressure and
concurrent workloads therefore limit production latency conclusions. Native
Ollama, one request/model at a time; no new cloud instances or paid inference.

Use unchanged main generate/refine handlers through a temporary loopback test
harness, with disposable fixture-only PostgreSQL and the coded catalog. This
avoids the tracked automatic Compose model override and unrelated background
services. The unchanged Python evaluator supplies/scorers the 31 v1 requests.
The harness injects a synthetic authenticated tenant: it does not test login,
RLS policy installation, full API startup, real connector execution, Temporal
workers, agent tool calling or approvals. Those remain separate sandbox gates.

Record source/binary/corpus/prompt/schema hashes, model digest, Ollama version,
actual serving model, context4096, seed42, temperature0, thinking mode, repair
limit, request timeout and serial execution. Capture original failed responses,
not only final scores. A runtime compatibility failure is not an accuracy score.

The first comparison is a measured checkpoint. Model promotion requires two
full runs per candidate, the expanded promotion suite, intended-hardware latency,
and separate agent tool-use tests. Model switch and planner-contract changes
must be reviewed separately so attribution remains clear.

## Promotion gates

Schema >=99%, structure >=95%, activities/direction >=95%, grounding >=90%,
refinement preservation >=90%, correct clarification/rejection >=95%, at most
one repair per case, no invented secrets/connector IDs, no OOM or sustained swap.
Warm p95 <30 seconds is evaluated on intended deployment hardware. Always report
all-case pass count, HTTP failures and category coverage beside applicable rates.

## Executed local baseline

Qwen3:8b completed all 31 cases: **9 passed (29.03%)**, 12 HTTP422 failures,
11 ready responses, 4 needs-input and 4 rejected. There were 50 actual model
calls, all verified as qwen3:8b with the pinned settings. Three adversarial
passes were deterministic API guards without inference: this measures the
model-plus-handler system, not standalone model intelligence.

| Category | Qwen3 baseline |
| --- | --- |
| Generation | 2/8 |
| Refinement | 0/5 |
| Ambiguity | 2/4 |
| Branching | 0/3 |
| Engines/triggers | 0/6 |
| Adversarial | 5/5 |

API mean latency was 34.70s, p95 62.52s. A mid-run snapshot showed 5.6GB model
residency on GPU/context4096 and host swap usage 17567.81MiB. No pre-run swap
measurement exists; this cannot attribute swap to the model or establish a
controlled production latency/stability result. Schema-valid=100% in the report
excludes HTTP failures; do not present it as overall request reliability.

## Benchmark defects confirmed before testing the challenger

An offline proof exercised the unchanged evaluator's request preparation and
strict preservation scorer, then checked one actual captured refinement prompt:

- Five refinement cases preserve six connector configs without mandatory
  connectionId. The outgoing request is unmodified. Adding the required IDs
  lowers preservation to 0.6667–0.9; per-case passing requires exactly 1.0.
- gen-postgres-snowflake requires config.mode=upsert, which the current coded
  grounding contract forbids.

At least six distinct cases are impossible under current API/scorer contracts;
the v1 theoretical maximum is at most 25/31. All six failed in this baseline.
The original 31-case report remains intact for comparison. Correct this in a
versioned corpus (G11) with golden positive outputs and consistent symbolic
fixture bindings, not by silently discarding failures or lowering expectations.
Historical August runs used a different commit, so this proof alone does not
establish the exact cause of every historical failure.

[Corpus-conflict evidence](evals/corpus-conflicts.json). The runnable offline
proof and raw synthetic API/model traces are retained with the local experiment.

Separately, main's prompt lists config names and required markers but omits
allowed types/enum values; config JSON schema is generic. Retained responses
show rejected format/layer/syncMode/pageSize guesses. Explicit prompt/schema
constraints are a concrete planner improvement to evaluate independently of weights.

## CI evidence

[PR38 tests](https://github.com/Cohestra/cohestra-dataflow/actions/runs/34389928849/job/102595433239)
passed community/enterprise race tests and vet; frontend and both-edition builds
also passed. Overall CI is not green:

- [History scan](https://github.com/Cohestra/cohestra-dataflow/actions/runs/34389928849/job/102595432908)
  reported two detections, also reported on exact baseline main's
  [security job](https://github.com/Cohestra/cohestra-dataflow/actions/runs/34274080469/job/102222660483).
  Logs do not disclose affected values or establish whether credentials are live.
- [Workflow image scan](https://github.com/Cohestra/cohestra-dataflow/actions/runs/34389928849/job/102595433788)
  reports four unique advisories: Thrift CVE-2026-43871, x/crypto CVE-2026-56854,
  x/net CVE-2026-46600, gRPC CVE-2026-84445 (three high, one critical).
  Dependencies are unchanged. Baseline already flagged the first three; an
  additional report on unchanged gRPC is consistent with scanner database
  freshness, not a newly introduced dependency. Exploitability is not established.

G10 tracks separate triage/remediation and rerunning skipped downstream security
checks; a documentation-only diff is not grounds to waive those failures.

## Challenger status and decision

The official Granite4.2 8B pull is underway. A paired result will be appended
once download and the same 31-case run complete. Neither the existing baseline
nor an untested challenger is promoted. New model capability claims cannot
resolve G11 or substitute for the missing native agent tool-use acceptance suite.
