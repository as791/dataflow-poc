## Code of conduct

All participation is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please read it before contributing.

## Ways to contribute

- **Bug reports** — open an issue using the bug report template.
- **Feature requests** — open an issue using the feature request template.
- **Connectors** — the easiest first contribution; no Go knowledge required (see below).
- **Docs** — fix a typo, improve a setup guide, write a tutorial.
- **Bug fixes / features** — fork, branch, PR (see process below).

## Dev setup

Prerequisites: Docker + Compose v2, Go ≥ 1.25, Node ≥ 20, `npm`.

```bash
# Clone and install JS deps
git clone https://github.com/as791/dataflow-poc.git
cd dataflow-poc
npm install

# Run the full stack locally
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

For frontend hot reload while the stack remains containerized:

```bash
npm run dev:web              # Vite dev server on :3000
```

Run tests before opening a PR:

```bash
cd apps/workflow-go && go test -race ./...
cd ../.. && npm -w @dataflow/shared test
npm -w @dataflow/web test
npm run build
docker compose config --quiet
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) also runs `go vet`, `npm audit`, and
`govulncheck`. Make sure it passes before requesting review.

## Making a change

1. **Fork** the repo and create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```
2. Make your changes. Keep the scope focused — one logical change per PR.
3. Add or update tests for non-trivial logic.
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` if the change is user-visible.
5. Sign off your commits (see [DCO](#developer-certificate-of-origin)).
6. Open a PR against `main`.

## Commit format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]

Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`

**Scope** (optional): `web`, `api`, `worker`, `connectors`, `shared`, `db`, `ci`

Examples:
```
feat(connectors): add Stripe webhook manifest
fix(web): correct contrast on dark mode pipeline badges
docs: add ClickHouse connector example to CONNECTORS.md
```

Breaking changes: add `!` after the type/scope or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

## Pull request process

1. Fill in the PR template — summary, changes, test plan.
2. A maintainer reviews the change. Small, focused PRs are easier to evaluate.
3. Address review feedback with new commits (do not force-push during review).
4. Once approved and CI is green, a maintainer will merge (squash or merge commit).
5. The branch is deleted after merge.

**For large features**: open a discussion or a draft PR first to align on design
before doing a lot of work.

## Contributing a connector

The fastest path — **no Go** — is a manifest. Add a `*.manifest.json` to
`connectors/manifests/` or point `CONNECTORS_DIR` at a directory of manifests
(loaded on restart). Full schema and a worked example are in
[docs/CONNECTORS.md](docs/CONNECTORS.md).

For connectors a manifest cannot express (OAuth, change feeds, GraphQL, SDK
authentication), add it to `apps/workflow-go/internal/connectors`; see the same
doc.

A good connector PR includes:
- The manifest or Go implementation plus any new config `fields`
- A note on auth, pagination, and incremental/cursor behavior
- A focused Go test for coded connector behavior

## Repository layout

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `apps/web/` | React + Vite frontend (canvas, AI builder, monitoring) |
| `apps/workflow-go/` | Go API, Temporal workflow worker, activity worker, and connectors |
| `packages/shared/` | Pipeline types, Mermaid mapping |
| `connectors/manifests/` | User-defined HTTP connector manifests |
| `db/` | Postgres migrations (numbered, run in order) |
| `docs/` | Architecture decision records and design docs |
| `scripts/` | Dev bootstrap and utility scripts |
| `observability/` | Prometheus / Grafana configs |

## Conventions

- **Go**: `gofmt`, standard idioms, table-driven tests.
- **TypeScript**: strict mode; match surrounding style and comment density.
- **New DB columns with `tenant_id`** must be covered by the RLS policy in
  `db/003_rls.sql`.
- **No `dist/` in source**: `@dataflow/*` packages build to `dist/`; don't
  commit compiled output.
- **Security-sensitive paths** (codec, auth, credential and payload storage)
  require focused maintainer review.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

All commits must be signed off to certify you wrote the contribution or have
the right to submit it under the Apache 2.0 license. Add this to every commit:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

Use Git's sign-off flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: my change"
```
